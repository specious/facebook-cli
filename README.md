  - Click "Save Changes"
- Go to the "App Review" tab
  - Flip the switch that says "Your app is in **development** and unavailable to the public."
  - Click "Confirm" to make your app live ([why?](# "This is required for any content you publish through this app to be visible to other users."))
- Go to the "Dashboard" tab
  - Under "App Secret" click "Show" to reveal your app secret
  - Open a terminal and save your App ID and App Secret by running:<br>

    ```
    facebook-cli config --appid=<app-id> --appsecret=<app-secret>
    ```

## Why can't I...?

Facebook has removed a large portion of their Graph API starting with version 2.0. [Niraj Shah](https://github.com/niraj-shah) has done a fantastic job documenting the cutbacks and their implications in these blog posts:

* [Facebook API: Graph API v2.4 Released, Removes Groups, Notifications and Stream Permissions](https://www.webniraj.com/2015/07/14/facebook-api-graph-api-v2-4-released-removes-groups-notifications-and-stream-permissions/)
* [Facebook Announces Graph API v2.3, More Deprecations](https://www.webniraj.com/2015/03/26/facebook-announces-graph-api-v2-3-more-deprecations/)
* [Facebook API: Getting Friends Using Graph API 2.0 and PHP SDK 4.0.x](https://www.webniraj.com/2014/06/12/facebook-api-getting-friends-using-graph-api-2-0-and-php-sdk-4-0-x/)

In an [article](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/10/10/growing-quality-apps-with-open-graph/) published in October, 2012, Facebook developer [Henry Zhang](https://www.facebook.com/hzz) wrote:

> Post to friends wall via the API generate a high levels of negative user feedback, including “Hides” and “Mark as Spam" and so we are removing it from the API. If you want to allow people to post to their friend’s timeline from your app, you can invoke the feed dialog.

With so much functionality removed, it's not possible to build a full-featured interface to Facebook through the API.
